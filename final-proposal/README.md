Predictors of Sickle Cell-Prone Hemoglobin Genotypes in Under-Five Children in Congo: A Logistic Regression Analysis

Objective: To identify and evaluate the predictors of sickle cell-prone hemoglobin genotypes (AS, SS) among under-five children in Congo using a logistic regression model. The study aims to explore the relationship between the occurrence of sickle cell-prone hemoglobin and key independent variables, including sample collection site (heel, umbilical cord, other), ethnicity, age group (neonatal, infant, under-five), and gender (boys, girls).  
Plan 
Activity 1: Data Preparation and Understanding (due by Dec 6)
Objective: Understand the dataset and ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
-	Import and explore the data in R, checks for missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies, produce data dictionary
-	Conduct descriptive analysis
Outcomes: 
-	A cleaned dataset ready for logistic regression modelling.
-	Descriptive statistics report summarizing key findings from the initial data exploration.
Activitiyt 2: Modelling and analysis (due dec 7)
Objective: Fit logistic regression model.
-	Produce working logistic regression code
-	Summary of the model specification, including variables included in final model
-	Analyze the results of the logistic regression model and interpret key findings.
-	Run the logistic regression model and evaluate the outputs
Activitiyt 3: Report writing and submission (due dec 12)
-	Produce 15 minutes presentations
